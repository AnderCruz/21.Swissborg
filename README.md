Data analyst tech challenge

The Swissborg app allows users to easily buy and trade cryptos. Users can make fiat or crypto deposits and withdrawals, trade between any two currencies directly, and even earn additional yield on some tokens.

Your task will be to explore some key aspects of our user acquisition and conversion from the first steps of onboarding all the way to making deposits, carrying out exchanges or subscribing to a yield wallet. The goal of this exercise is to highlight pain points or areas of opportunity for improvement, and support the goal setting process by providing clear and measurable KRs (key results).
